# ReadyKitRenderer
Daz Plugin Stub for creating Renderman compatible Render Plugins

This project is a DazStudio Render Plugin framework which can be used to build a Daz Studio Renderer.  It is based off of yaluxplug and is generalized to support a 3rd party rendering library or executable.

Back in 2015, I wrote a Daz Studio Renderman compatible Render Plugin for rendering to Luxrender, which I had intended to be released as Open Source from the beginning.  However, I decided to not release it because I did not want to diminish from the success of the other Luxrender-based Daz Plugins that were still being actively developed at that time.  Since it has been a few years since those other Luxrender Plugins were updated, I think it's time to open up the Daz Developer scene to an alternative GPU based renderer.
